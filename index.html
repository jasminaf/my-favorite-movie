        <h4>Reviews</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Excellent - Spielberg's Best!</p>
          <footer>An incredible movie. One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting. Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human. He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic.</footer>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Amazing!</p>
          <footer>This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the Holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words.</footer>

        <h4>Interesting facts</h4>
        <img src="img/sl3.jpg" alt="Schindler's List" height="10%" height="10%">
        <ul>
          <li>Ralph Fiennes put on 13kg by drinking Guinness for his role of Amon Goeth. Steven Spielberg cast him because of his "evil sexuality".</li>
          <li>Steven Spielberg was not paid for this film. He refused to accept a salary, citing that it would be "blood money". Instead, he gave the money to the Shoah Foundation.</li>
          <li>When survivor Mila Pfefferberg was introduced to Ralph Fiennes on the set, she began shaking uncontrollably, as he reminded her too much of the real Amon Goeth.</li>
          <li>Steven Spielberg offered the job of director to Roman Polanski. Polanski turned it down because the subject was too personal. He had lived in the Krakow ghetto until the age of 8, when he escaped on the day of the liquidation. His mother later died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. After learning this, Spielberg immediately and repeatedly apologized for bringing up such a traumatic memory. Polanski would later direct his own film about the Holocaust,<a href="#">The Pianist</a> (2002).</a></li>
          <li>Director Steven Spielberg was able to get permission to film inside Auschwitz, but chose not to out of respect for the victims, so the scenes of the death camp were actually filmed outside the gates on a set constructed in a mirror image of the real location on the other side.</li>
